/*
    The Fibonacci Sequence is a famous sequence of numbers. Read more here: https://www.mathsisfun.com/numbers/fibonacci-sequence.html
    
    The sequence starts with 0 and 1. Each number after that, is the sum of the previous 2 numbers in the sequence.
    So the third number in the sequence is 1, because 0 + 1 = 1. 
        Now we have 0, 1, 1.
    The fourth number in the sequence is 2, because 1 + 1 = 2. (the last 2 numbers in the sequence were 1 and 1)
        Now we have 0, 1, 1, 2.
    The fifth number in the sequence is 3, because 1 + 2 = 3. (the last 2 numbers in the sequence were 1 and 2)
    And so on... If we go a bit further the sequence looks like 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13,....

    Can you implement a function that will generate the first n numbers in this sequence (starting with 0 and 1)?
        - the input n will be passed in to the function as an argument, and will be a number greater than 2

// function generateFibonacciSequence(n) {
//     // TODO
// }


function generateFibonacciSequence(n) {
    let fibonacciSequence = [];

    // just initialise the first 2 values in the sequence
    fibonacciSequence[0] = 0;
    fibonacciSequence[1] = 1;

    // the remaining numbers can be calculated
    for (i = 2; i < n; i++) {
        // each number is equal to the sum of the previous 2 numbers
        fibonacciSequence[i] = fibonacciSequence[i - 2] + fibonacciSequence[i - 1];
    }

    return fibonacciSequence;
