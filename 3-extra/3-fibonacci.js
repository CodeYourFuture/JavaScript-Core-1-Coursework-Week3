/*
    The Fibonacci Sequence is a famous sequence of numbers. Read more here: https://www.mathsisfun.com/numbers/fibonacci-sequence.html
    
    The sequence starts with 0 and 1. Each number after that, is the sum of the previous 2 numbers in the sequence.
    So the third number in the sequence is 1, because 0 + 1 = 1. 
        Now we have 0, 1, 1.
    The fourth number in the sequence is 2, because 1 + 1 = 2. (the last 2 numbers in the sequence were 1 and 1)
        Now we have 0, 1, 1, 2.
    The fifth number in the sequence is 3, because 1 + 2 = 3. (the last 2 numbers in the sequence were 1 and 2)
    And so on... If we go a bit further the sequence looks like 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13,....

    Can you implement a function that will generate the first n numbers in this sequence (starting with 0 and 1)?
        - the input n will be passed in to the function as an argument, and will be a number greater than 2

function generateFibonacciSequence(n) {
  let fib = [0, 1];
  let data = [0, 1];

  for (let i = 2; i < n; i++) {
    fib[i] = fib[i - 1] + fib[i - 2];
    data.push(fib[i]);
  }
  console.log(data);
  return data;
}
