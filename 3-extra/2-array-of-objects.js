/*
    This exercise includes an array of objects. You can read more about objects here: https://javascript.info/object

    Imagine you're working for an online store selling books (like Amazon).
    Below, we have an array of book objects.
    Each object contains the title of the book, the genre, and a rating based on user reviews.
    
    We want to find the title of the highest rated book in each genre to showcase on our home page.
    Implement a function which takes the array of books as a parameter, and returns an array of book titles.
    Each title in the resulting array should be the highest rated book in its genre.
*/

function getHighestRatedInEachGenre(books) {
    // this will be an object where the property will be a genre, and the value will be an object representing the book
    let highestRated = {};

    for(let book of books) {
        // if this is the first time we're seeing this genre OR the rating we've seen is not as high as the current book
        if(highestRated[book.genre] === undefined || highestRated[book.genre].rating < book.rating) {
            // then this book is now the highest rated in the genre so far
            highestRated[book.genre] = book;
        }
    }

    // Here we just want to get the highest rated books (the values of the object)
    // and then get the title for each one
    return Object.values(highestRated)
            .map(book => book.title);
