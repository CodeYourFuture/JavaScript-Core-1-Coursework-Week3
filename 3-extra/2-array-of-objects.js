/*
    This exercise includes an array of objects. You can read more about objects here: https://javascript.info/object

    Imagine you're working for an online store selling books (like Amazon).
    Below, we have an array of book objects.
    Each object contains the title of the book, the genre, and a rating based on user reviews.
    
    We want to find the title of the highest rated book in each genre to showcase on our home page.
    Implement a function which takes the array of books as a parameter, and returns an array of book titles.
    Each title in the resulting array should be the highest rated book in its genre.
*/

function getHighestRatedInEachGenre(books) {
    // TODO
    // Create an object to store the highest rated book for each genre
  const highestRatedBooks = {};

  // Loop through the array of books
  books.forEach(book => {
    const { title, genre, rating } = book;
    // Check if there is no highest rated book for the genre yet or if the current book has a higher rating
    if (!highestRatedBooks[genre] || rating > highestRatedBooks[genre].rating) {
      highestRatedBooks[genre] = { title, rating };
    }
  });

  // Map the highest rated book for each genre to an array of titles
  const titles = Object.values(highestRatedBooks).map(book => book.title);

  return titles;
