/*
    for loops can be useful when we already know exactly how many times we want to loop.

    Below we have 2 arrays which have exactly the same number of values.
        - The first array is a list of writers
        - The second array is a list of ages
    The writers in the first array correspond with the ages in the second array.
    For example, Virginia Woolf is 59 years old.

    Using a for loop, output to the console a line about the age of each writer.

const WRITERS = [
    "Virginia Woolf",
    "Zadie Smith",
    "Jane Austen",
    "Bell Hooks",
    "Yukiko Motoya"

const AGES = [
    59,
    40,

// TODO - Write for loop code here

/*
The output should look something like this:

Virginia Woolf is 59 years old
Zadie Smith is 40 years old
Jane Austen is 41 years old
Bell Hooks is 63 years old
Yukiko Motoya is 49 years old
