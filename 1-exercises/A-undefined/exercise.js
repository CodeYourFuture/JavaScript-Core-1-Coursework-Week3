/*
    By now, you would have already seen "undefined", either in an error message or being output from your program.
    But what does it mean? undefined represents the absence of a value.
    
    In some cases, undefined will be used by a programmer intentionally, and they will write code to handle it.
    But usually, when you see undefined - it means something has gone wrong!

    Below are 4 typical examples of when you would see undefined.
    For each example, can you explain why we are seeing undefined?
*/

// Example 1
// let a;
// console.log(a);


// // Example 2
// function sayHello(a) {
//     let message = "Hello2";
//     return message
// }

// let hello = sayHello();
// console.log(hello);


// Example 3
function sayHelloToUser(user) {
    console.log(`Hello ${user}`); // this will return hello and then undefined because we did not declare 
                                // of the variable user. 
}

sayHelloToUser();



// Example 4
let arr = [1,2,3];
console.log(arr[3]);
